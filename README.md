# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This project is a Cluedo random mysterypicker. The goal is to practice using arrays, objects and loops.

I started with coding the javascript part, and making all the functions on the page work. After that I started with the styling of the page. This project I did not use Trello for planning as much as in the earlier projects, and to next project I will go back to my planning-board in Trello.
