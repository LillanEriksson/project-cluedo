# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This project is to make a Cluedo random mysterypicker. The goal is to practice using arrays, objects and loops.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started with coding the javascript part, and making all the functions on the page work. After that I started with the styling of the page. This project I did not use Trello for planning as much as in the earlier projects, and to next assignment I will go back to my planning-board in Trello.

If I had more time I would have written some of the functions to be re-usable.
